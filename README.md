# Android-Project-Using-Kotlin

In this Project we are building an Android App which is capable of accessing system apps. This project is written in Kotlin and we have provided Login and Sign up for user using a Shared Preference. Shared Preference in Android are used to save data based on key-value pair. The Data will be saved in device local database and the app can implicitly open Google Maps, Calculator, can set Calender events, Dial pad with cell number, Contacts, Browser, Camera, can set Alarm, Email, etc. Along with this we have added the log out option as well.
