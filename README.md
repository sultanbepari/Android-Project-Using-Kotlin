# Android-Project-Using-Kotlin

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Project I am building an Android App which is capable of accessing system apps. This project is written in Kotlin and I have provided Login and Sign up for user using a Shared Preference. Shared Preference in Android are used to save data based on key-value pair. The Data will be saved in device local database and the app can implicitly open Google Maps, Calculator, can set Calender events, Dial pad with cell number, Contacts, Browser, Camera, can set Alarm, Email, etc. Along with this I have added the log out option as well. In the Login activity I have remember me checkbox, if user checked that checkbox then it will automatically take username and password from database user can directly click on login But, whenever user clicked log out then remember me will be unchecked then user again need to provide the username and password.
